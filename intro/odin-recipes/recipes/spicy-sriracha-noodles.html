        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Oh WOW. It should be illegal for noodles to be this easy AND this delicious. These spicy sriracha noodles 
            are my new favorite quick fix! They only take about 15 minutes to make, they're totally rich, flavorful, 
            and SUPER SPICY. Like, “burn a hole through your stomach” spicy. Call me crazy, but sometimes I want that. 
            No, I crave that. So, this one goes out to all of you heat seekers!</p>
        <p>The simple sauce for this recipe uses only pantry staples (soy sauce, brown sugar, sriracha), which 
            perfectly balance the sweet, salty, and spicy flavors. The richness of the butter helps smooth everything 
            out, cilantro adds a fresh note, and the green onions lend a savory back note. It all just works and it 
            happens to be incredibly simple. And that's how I like my food.</p>
        <p>If you can't find the same noodles that I used, don't fret. You could make this with instant ramen noodles 
            or even regular linguine. The noodles are just the vehicle for all of the other yummy ingredients! </p>
        <p>Want to take it up a notch? Try my Dragon Noodle Variations: Pork and Peanut Dragon Noodles, or Lime Shrimp 
            Dragon Noodles. Many readers have also commented that they've added extra vegetables (try adding some frozen 
            stir fry vegetables), but you'll probably want to double the sauce if adding a lot of extra vegetables.</p>
