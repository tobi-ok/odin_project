        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the things you will need to get before making this dish:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sauce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/3 cup water</li>
                <li>1 tsp sriracha</li>                
            </ul>
            <li>Stir Fry</li>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 lb. broccoli</li>
                <li>2 carrots</li>
                <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
                <li>1 small onion</li>
                <li>2 green onions</li>
                <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/3 lbs. total)</li>
                <li>3 Tbsp cooking oil, divided</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Stir Fry Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the stir fry sauce first. Stir fry recipes cook fast, so you want the sauce to be ready when 
                it's time to add it to the skillet.</li>
            <li>Use a big wok or very large skillet. In order for all of the chicken and vegetables to fit in the 
                skillet with enough space to cook fairly evenly, you'll want to use a big wok or large skillet. 
                We used a 12-inch skillet for this recipe.</li>
            <li>Don't overcook the vegetables. You want the vegetables to just be tender-crisp and vibrantly colored. 
                You can always cook them a little longer once the sauce is added at the end, but if you cook them too 
                long in the first steps you'll end up with limp vegetables that are a drab color.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Chicken Stir Fry</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the stir fry sauce. Combine the soy sauce, brown sugar, toasted sesame oil, garlic, 
                ginger, sriracha, cornstarch and water in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside.</li>
            <li>Chop the broccoli into small florets. Slice the red bell pepper, onion, and carrots into similar sized
                 pieces. Slice the green onions. Set all the vegetables aside.</li>
            <li>Next, cut the chicken breasts into small 1/2 inch sized pieces. </li>
            <li>Heat a very large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Once hot add 2 Tbsp of cooking oil and swirl to 
                coat the surface of the skillet. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides. Be careful not to 
                overcook the chicken. Once the chicken is browned, remove it from the skillet onto a separate plate and 
                set aside.</li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 Tbsp of cooking oil along with the carrots and broccoli. Cook 
                and stir for one minute, or just until the broccoli begins to turn bright green.</li>
            <li>Next, add the red bell pepper and onion to the skillet. Continue to cook and stir for 1-2 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Give the stir fry sauce another brief stir. Now add the cooked chicken back to the skillet, then pour the stir 
                fry sauce over the chicken and vegetables. Give everything a stir and allow the sauce to come up to a simmer, 
                at which point it will start to thicken and turn glossy. Continue to cook for 1-2 more minutes or until it has 
                reached your desired doneness.</li>
            <li>Remove the chicken stir fry from the heat, top with green onions and sesame seeds (optional) and serve! </li>
        </ol>
