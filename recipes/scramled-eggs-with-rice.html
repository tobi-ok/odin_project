        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rice is a quintessential budget-friendly ingredient, and my slogan has always been “put an egg on it!” 
            So when I saw this recipe for Scrambled Eggs with Rice from the new cookbook The Simple Art of Rice: 
            Recipes from Around the World for the Heart of Your Table by JJ Johnson and Danica Novgorodoff, I knew 
            I had to make it. Not to mention, this recipe features the ingredient I currently can't get enough of, 
            gochujang! If you love fried rice, you're going to love this recipe for scrambled eggs with rice. It's 
            just as easy, hearty, and delicious, plus it's totally customizable. I'm definitely going to add this 
            one to my budget-recipe rotation!</p>
        <p>Chef JJ mentions in his book that the recipe is inspired by breakfast dishes found in both Japanese and 
            Korean cultures. This incredibly simple yet satisfying dish is similar to fried rice, but the ratio 
            between the rice and egg are a bit more even and the rice is stirred into the egg before it's fully 
            cooked, which gives the dish a slightly creamy texture. Best of all, it's super fast and easy, so you 
            really can make it on a typical morning (provided you have some cooked rice stashed in the refrigerator). 
            It's the perfect recipe for using up the leftovers in your fridge!</p>

            <li>Warm the vegetable oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the eggs and scramble
