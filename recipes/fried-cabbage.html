        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Fried cabbage is an incredibly underrated side dish, IMHO. 
            It's cheap, you only need a handful of simple ingredients, and it goes with everything. 
            Plus, cabbage is one of my favorite budget ingredients because it's so filling and nutritious, 
            and you really don't need a lot to make it taste great. This Fried Cabbage recipe is as easy 
            as it gets and it's so good that I find myself making it over and over. It's one of those recipes 
            where I actually look forward to eating the leftovers!</p>
            
        <p>Fried cabbage is a classic Southern side dish that you're likely to find at BBQ joints and soul 
            food kitchens across the Southern United States. It's simply chopped cabbage that has been fried 
            in bacon grease until golden brown and delicious. Seriously, words can not describe how amazing 
            this melt-in-your-mouth cabbage is.</p>
        <p>The bacon and chicken broth bring a large portion of the flavor to this dish, but you do have options 
            if you'd like to make a vegetarian fried cabbage recipe. Simply swap out the chicken broth for vegetable 
            broth or a vegetarian “chicken” flavored broth to start. To replace the smoky flavor and fatty mouthfeel 
            of the bacon, I suggest either adding more butter or a tablespoon of coconut oil and some smoked paprika. 
            You may also want to increase the seasoning salt to replace the salt from the bacon.</p>
        <p>Fried cabbage is quite delicious as a leftover and you don't need to take any special measures when 
            refrigerating it. Simply place it in a food storage container and refrigerate for up to five days. To 
            reheat the fried cabbage you can either microwave until hot or place it back into a non-stick skillet 
            and sauté over medium heat until heated through. I do not suggest freezing fried cabbage as it will likely 
            get very mushy upon thawing.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Here are the things you will need to get before making this dish:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 head green cabbage (about 1.25 lbs or 6 cups chopped)</li>
            <li>4 oz. bacon</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp seasoning salt</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the bacon to a very large skillet and cook over medium heat until the bacon is brown and 
                crispy. Remove the bacon from the skillet and drain the excess bacon fat, leaving about 2 Tbsp 
                in the skillet (reserve the drained fat for later).</li>
            <li>While the bacon is cooking, finely dice the onion and chop the cabbage into 1-inch pieces. </li>
            <li>After removing the bacon from the skillet, add the diced onion and continue to saute over medium 
                heat until the onions become soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). The moisture from the onions 
                will begin to dissolve the browned bacon bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
            <li>Once the onions are soft, add the chopped cabbage and chicken broth. Continue to let the cabbage 
                cook over medium, stirring occasionally, until it has softened, most of the liquid has evaporated, 
                and the edges begin to brown. If the skillet dries up before the cabbage is soft, add 2 Tbsp of 
                water and continue to saute until softened. </li>
            <li>Once the cabbage is soft and the liquid has evaporated, add the butter to the skillet and stir 
                until it has melted and coated the cabbage. Turn the heat off and add the seasoning salt, 
                starting with 1/4 tsp, then adding more to taste.</li>
            <li>Finally, crumble the cooked bacon and stir it back into the cabbage. Give the cabbage a taste and 
                adjust to your liking. Garnish with some freshly cracked pepper, serve, and enjoy!</li>
        </ul>
